panda web framework
===================
I want to build a framework building on top of netty and akka,and make the life easier for java developers,
and we could using actor model or handler/callback model,as withActor(props) or withHandler(handler)
to finish the work.

All I am working on just build on top others' great work :P

required sbt,java7

target java,not scala cause I am not good at scala

##How to run
cd framework

sbt run

##RoadMap

5,steam api
